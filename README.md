# VROWorkflowViewer

This Utility allows someone working with VRO Workflows represented in XML format to be viewed more easily.


Typically when VRO Workflow items are sent to a version control system such as a GIT repository they are exported into XML format and then uploaded to a central GIT repository.
Small Workflows are fairly straightforward to view but some workflows can have multiple WorkFlow Items and the sequencing can be a little odd and therefore readability of the XML data is cumbersome.
This utility reads the XML data and parses the data into multiple TABs of a Windows Form adding simple navigation controls for ease of reading.
